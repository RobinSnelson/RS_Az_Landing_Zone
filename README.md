# Azure Landing Zone 

This repository has been createdfor me to create my version of the terraform code for the [CloudSkills](https://cloudskills.io/) "Well Architected Azure Landing Zones Deep Dive" course by [Corey Knapp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coreyknapp/). In the course Corey Uses ARM templates and I am a real fan of Terraform so I decided to practice one whilst learning the other.

I have broken down the different compants into what I think is relevant areas, I really like the way Corey has divided and grouped the resources and his (infact I really like to see how poeople do this it gives you great ideas) so I ahve mimiced that here.
